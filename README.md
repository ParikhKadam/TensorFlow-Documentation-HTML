# TensorFlow-Documentation-HTML
Tensorflow documents are nowhere to find so I built this documentation from source
The instructions are available at https://www.tensorflow.org/community/documentation

Since this documentation was built on my local machine, there might exist some
broken links. If a link is broken, you may need to change the link manually, by changing
.md to .html.


I've created an additional file tensorflow.html in directory tensorflow/api_guides/tensorflow.html,
it is a duplicate of the index file in the same directory, this way you can just search the file 
name to directly access the documentation.
